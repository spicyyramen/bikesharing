# Summary
The results suggest the majority of bike-sharing users will utilize the service to commute to and from work. Furthermore, it appears men more frequently use CitiBike versus women. Since the service is primarily used for commuting, frequent users are likely to subscribe to the service. Nonsubscribers are more likely to utilize the service on weekends, presumably for leisure activities. 

Two additional visualizations could be 1. Subscribers vs Nonsubscribers start times & day of the week, and 2. Subscribers vs Nonsubscribers trip duration for each day of the week.
